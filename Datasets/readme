To train our model, the following datasets are used:

For YOLO detection model, please use dataset from our team's self-created open sourced Roboflow dataset, downloadable via this code:

rf = Roboflow(api_key="## USE YOUR OWN API KEY ##")

project = rf.workspace("tiffanyzha").project("oneclassfridgedata")

version = project.version(1)

dataset = version.download("yolov5")

For EfficientNet model, please download the zip file of datasets for cropped images via google drive shared link:
