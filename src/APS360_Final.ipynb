Title: Teeny-Weeny Coxinha, Cosine Similarity: 0.2635\n","\n","Ingredients:\n","['1 quart vegetable oil, for frying', '3 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth', '1 onion, peeled and quartered', '1 carrot, peeled and quartered', '1 celery rib,\n","quartered', '1 large chicken breast', '8 ounces packaged cream cheese, softened', '1 ear corn, kernels cut off the cob', '2 green onions, thinly sliced', '1\n","garlic clove, minced', 'Salt and pepper, to taste', '1/2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil', '2 cups all-purpose flour', '1 egg', '1 tablespoon whole milk', '1\n","cup plain Italian bread crumbs', 'Salt and pepper', 'to taste']\n","\n","Instructions:\n","1. In a large pot, preheat oil to 350°F. In another large pot, combine broth, onions, carrots, and celery and bring to a simmer. Carefully add chicken, cover,\n","and reduce heat to medium-low. Poach chicken for 12 to 15 minutes, or until just cooked through. Turn off heat, but leave the pot of hot poaching liquid on the\n","stove. Remove chicken from liquid and let it rest for 10 minutes. 2. For the filling, finely chop or shred chicken into a large mixing bowl. Add cream cheese,\n","corn, green onions, and garlic. Season with salt and pepper. Fold to combine. 3. Strain 1 1/2 cups of the poaching liquid and discard the rest. In a saucepan\n","over high heat, bring reserved liquid and oil to a boil. Add flour and stir vigorously until dough forms. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and\n","knead until smooth, about 5 minutes. Roll out to 1/4 inch thick. Cut out small rounds using a 3-inch circle cutter or the rim of a round cup. Place a small\n","scoop (about 1 tablespoon) of the filling in the center of each round. Pinch dough together at the top to seal, creating plump little teardrop-shaped pouches.\n","In a small bowl, lightly whisk eggs and milk together. Place bread crumbs in another small bowl. Carefully dip each pouch into the egg wash and then the bread\n","crumbs until fully coated. Fry coxinha in small batches for 7 to 9 minutes, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, lightly season with salt, and serve\n","hot.\n","\n","Top2. Title: Not-So-Basic Meatloaf, Cosine Similarity: 0.2592\n","\n","Ingredients:\n","['5 strips lean bacon, finely chopped', '6 cloves garlic, minced', '2 medium onions, finely chopped', '1 medium carrot, finely chopped', '2 pounds very lean\n","ground beef sirloin', '2 large eggs', '1/2 cup milk', '1 cup finely ground fresh bread crumbs', '1/4 cup Dijon mustard', '1/4 cup barbecue sauce', '1 tablespoon\n","bottled horseradish, well drained', '1/2 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley', '2 tablespoons coarse salt', '1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper',\n","'1 teaspoon finely minced fresh thyme (or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme)', '2 to 3 cups croutons', '10 whole, unpeeled, garlic cloves', '4 bay leaves', '1 sprig\n","fresh thyme']\n","\n","Instructions:\n","Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Place the bacon in a medium sauté pan over medium-low heat. Sauté the bacon for about 5 minutes, or until it has begun to crisp\n","and most of the fat has rendered out. Add the garlic, onion, and carrot and continue to sauté for about 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft and the\n","onions are translucent but have not taken on any color. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the vegetables to cool (see Note). Place the ground sirloin into\n","a large mixing bowl. Add the eggs and milk and, using your hands, work the liquid into the meat. Add the bread crumbs and continue to work the liquid and crumbs\n","into the meat. Add the cooled vegetables, mustard, barbecue sauce, and horseradish along with 1/4 cup of the parsley, salt, pepper, and thyme. Using your hands,\n","gently work all of the ingredients into the meat until well combined. Place one-half of the croutons into a shallow baking dish at least 14 inches long.\n","Transfer the meatloaf mixture onto a clean, flat surface and, again, using your hands, shape it into a loaf about 3 1/4 inches wide X 2 1/2 inches high X 12\n","inches long (or into a round, breadlike form, a letter of the alphabet, an oval, or into several small loaves). Press the remaining croutons into the loaf,\n","making sure that they are partially pressed down into it. Gently press the unpeeled garlic cloves into the top of the meatloaf. Carefully lay the loaf on top of\n","the croutons in the baking dish (you might need to use a couple of spatulas to facilitate this), reforming the shape with your hands, if necessary. Pierce the\n","meatloaf with the bay leaves and thyme sprig. Place the meatloaf in the preheated oven and bake for 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reads 165 degrees\n","on an instant-read thermometer and the top is nicely browned. Remove the pan from the oven. Allow the meatloaf to rest for about 5 minutes before transferring\n","it to a serving platter. Remove the bay leaves and thyme sprig and sprinkle the remaining parsley over the top of the loaf and around the platter. Cut crosswise\n","into 1-inch, or thicker, slices and serve.\n","\n","Top3. Title: Arugula, Bacon, and Gruyère Bread Pudding, Cosine Similarity: 0.2582\n","\n","Ingredients:\n","['1 1/2 cups whole milk', '1/2 cup heavy cream', '5 large eggs', '6 bacon slices', '1 large shallot, finely chopped', '3 garlic cloves, chopped', '7 ounces baby\n","arugula or baby spinach (6 1/2 cups)', '6 cups cubed (1-inch) country-style bread (1 pound)', '5 1/2 ounces Gruyère cheese', 'coarsely grated (1 1/2 cups)']\n","\n","Instructions:\n","Preheat oven to 375°F with rack in middle. Butter a 2-qt shallow baking dish. Whisk together milk, cream, eggs, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper in a\n","large bowl. Cook bacon in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp. Transfer with tongs to paper towels to drain, then\n","coarsely crumble. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Increase heat to medium-high and cook shallot and garlic, stirring constantly, until golden,\n","about 1 minute. Gradually add arugula and cook, stirring, until it wilts. Stir arugula mixture, bacon, bread, and cheese into custard. Transfer to baking dish\n","and cover with foil. Bake 30 minutes, then remove foil and bake until golden in spots, about 10 minutes more.\n","\n","Top4. Title: Meatloaf, Cosine Similarity: 0.2552\n","\n","Ingredients:\n","['1 cup fine fresh bread crumbs (from 2 slices firm white sandwich bread)', '1/3 cup whole milk', '1 medium onion, finely chopped', '3 garlic cloves, minced',\n","'1 medium celery rib, finely chopped', '1 medium carrot, finely chopped', '2 tablespoons unsalted butter', '2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce', '1 tablespoon\n","cider vinegar', '1/4 teaspoon ground allspice', '1/4 pound bacon (about 4 slices), chopped', '1/2 cup pitted prunes, chopped', '1 1/2 pounds ground beef chuck',\n","'1/2 pound ground pork (not lean)', '2 large eggs', '1/3 cup finely chopped flat-leaf parsley', 'Garnish: cooked bacon']\n","\n","Instructions:\n","Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a large bowl. Meanwhile, cook onion, garlic, celery, and carrot in butter in a large\n","heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes. Cover skillet and reduce heat to low, then cook until carrot is tender, about 5 minutes.\n","Remove from heat and stir in Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, allspice, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper. Add to bread-crumb mixture. Finely chop\n","bacon and prunes in a food processor, then add to onion mixture along with beef, pork, eggs, and parsley and mix together with your hands. Pack mixture into a\n","9- by 5-inch oval loaf in a 13- by 9-inch shallow baking dish or pan.

Title: Spinach Gnocchi, Cosine Similarity: 0.2500\n","\n","Ingredients:\n","['10 ounces block frozen chopped spinach', '1 cup whole milk ricotta cheese', '2/3 cup parmesan cheese, plus 2 tbsp for sprinkling before serving.', '1 egg\n","yolk', '2 tablespoons flour', 'plus more for dusting your hands while rolling']\n","\n","Instructions:\n","Defrost the brick of frozen spinach (you can also do this in the microwave). Squeeze ALL (and I mean ALL) of the water out of the spinach in small handfuls (I\n","use my hands and do it over a bowl to make sure I don't lose any spinach). Place all of the ingredients in a food processor and pulse. You want to make sure the\n","spinach is in tiny pieces and the mixture is thoroughly combined. Dust your hands with a little flour so the mixture doesn't stick to your hands. Take 1\n","teaspoon of the spinach mixture and roll into tiny balls. Place on a plate covered with waxed paper or parchment. Bring a large pot of water to a boil for\n","cooking the gnocchi. Add the gnocchi to the water in batches and cook for 3 minutes or until they rise to the surface. Using a slotted spoon, remove the gnocchi\n","to a plate or bowl. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese, cool and serve. To Freeze: After step 5, place on sheet tray and freeze for 30 minutes. Transfer to a ziploc\n","bag, label and freeze up to 4 months.
